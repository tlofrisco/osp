# OSP Worker Deployment Status & Next Steps

## What We've Built: OSP Governance System

We successfully implemented a comprehensive manifest governance system for the One Service Platform (OSP) with the following features:

### Core Governance Features Implemented
- **Manifest Lifecycle Management**: Draft → Active → Deprecated/Locked status transitions
- **Field-Level Protection**: Locked fields enforcement preventing critical changes to `service_id`, `schema_name`, etc.
- **AI-Powered Audit Trails**: Comprehensive change tracking and analysis for Agent oversight
- **Real-time Governance Reporting**: Health monitoring and risk assessment

### Key Files Created/Modified
- `src/lib/osp/manifestAudit.ts` - Core governance engine
- `src/lib/osp/workerIntegration.ts` - Enhanced with governance validation
- `src/lib/manifestResolver.ts` - Added status filtering and governance checks
- `workers/generator/createWorkerFromManifest.js` - Deployment validation logic
- `test-governance.js` - Comprehensive test suite (19/19 tests passing)

### Supabase Backend Setup (Completed)
- `osp_metadata.manifest_audit_log` table with RLS policies
- `osp_metadata.manifest_governance_report` view for monitoring
- Proper security policies for service/authenticated/anonymous access

## Current Railway Deployment Issue

### Problem Summary
- **Worker Name**: `osp-worker` (currently deployed on Railway)
- **Status**: Build successful, but crashes on startup
- **Primary Error**: Missing `RAILWAY_TOKEN` environment variable

### Error Log Details
```json
{
  "severity": "error",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-13T00:11:27.832068690Z",
  "message": "❌ Missing required environment variable: RAILWAY_TOKEN",
  "tags": {
    "deploymentId": "c5626b35-6c95-4dfa-8052-48f3e08787a3",
    "serviceId": "7f465309-9373-40f8-b49c-bec37d90bc1b",
    "projectId": "f8c9b9fc-6faf-411c-9133-7724dc33113c"
  }
}
```

### Current Environment Status
- ✅ `RAILWAY_TOKEN` exists in local `.env` file
- ❓ Token may be incorrect or insufficient permissions
- ❓ `osp-worker` may not be the correct worker name for our use case
- ❓ Unclear if we need a fresh build/deployment

## Specific Next Steps Required

### 1. Railway Token Verification
- **Action**: Verify the Railway token has correct permissions
- **Location**: Check `.env` file vs Railway dashboard token
- **Question**: Does the token have deployment permissions for the OSP project?

### 2. Worker Name Clarification
- **Current**: `osp-worker` 
- **Question**: Is this the correct name for our governance-enabled worker?
- **Alternative**: Should we be deploying a specific service worker instead?

### 3. Environment Variable Setup
- **Required**: Ensure `RAILWAY_TOKEN` is properly set in Railway environment
- **Method**: Railway dashboard → Service → Variables tab
- **Verification**: Check that the token matches local `.env`

### 4. Fresh Deployment Strategy
- **Option A**: Fix existing `osp-worker` deployment
- **Option B**: Create new service with correct configuration
- **Question**: Should we start fresh or repair existing deployment?

## Key Files for Reference

### Worker Entry Points
- `workers/generator/createWorkerFromManifest.js` - Main worker generator
- `src/lib/osp/workerIntegration.ts` - Worker integration with governance
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration (recently updated)

### Configuration Files
- `.env` - Environment variables (local)
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- Railway environment variables (needs verification)

### Test Files
- `test-governance.js` - Governance system tests (all passing)

## Questions for Next Session

1. **Railway Token**: How do we verify the Railway token is correct and has proper permissions?
2. **Worker Identity**: Is `osp-worker` the right name, or should we deploy a specific service worker?
3. **Environment Setup**: What's the correct way to set Railway environment variables for our deployment?
4. **Fresh Start**: Should we delete the current `osp-worker` and redeploy, or fix in place?
5. **Worker Purpose**: What specific worker service are we trying to deploy (restaurant, antique car, etc.)?

## Success Criteria

When resolved, we should have:
- ✅ Single worker deployed successfully on Railway
- ✅ Worker can access governance system
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ No startup crashes or missing token errors
- ✅ Worker responds to health checks and service requests

## Background Context

This OSP system now includes enterprise-grade governance features that were successfully tested locally. The Railway deployment is the final step to make the governed worker system available in production. The governance system is designed to prevent deployment of draft manifests and provide comprehensive audit trails for AI/Agent oversight.
