# Sprint 1 Implementation Summary - UPDATED

## üéØ Goal: Foundation + One Complete Workflow

We successfully implemented the foundation for dynamic, AI-generated workflows that maintain three-legged stool coherence, plus significant improvements based on user feedback.

## üìã What We Built

### 1. **Enhanced OpenAI Prompting** (`src/routes/api/osp/service/+server.ts`)
- Replaced the schema-only generation with coherent three-legged generation
- The AI now generates schema, workflows, and UI components together
- Each entity includes workflow state tracking fields
- Every field is used by at least one workflow and UI component
- **NEW**: Increased token limit to 8000 for more comprehensive service generation
- **NEW**: Enhanced prompts to generate 3-5 workflows per service
- **NEW**: Added specific workflow suggestions for different service types

### 2. **Coherence Validation** (`validateServiceCoherence` function)
- Checks for orphan fields not used in workflows or UI
- Validates workflows have UI triggers
- Ensures UI components reference valid entities
- Logs warnings but doesn't block service creation

### 3. **Dynamic Temporal Worker** (`src/workers/dynamicWorker.ts`)
- Generic worker that can execute ANY AI-generated workflow
- Supports multiple activity types:
  - `create_entity` - Creates records in the database
  - `update_entity` - Updates existing records
  - `validate` - Validates data against rules
  - `notify` - Sends notifications (placeholder)
  - `calculate` - Performs calculations
  - `check_availability` - Checks for conflicts
- No hard-coded workflows - completely dynamic

### 4. **Workflow Trigger UI** (`src/lib/components/ui/workflow/WorkflowTriggers.svelte`)
- **FIXED**: Now loads workflows from service metadata instead of hardcoded data
- Shows manual trigger buttons for workflows
- Calls the workflow execution API
- Displays success/error messages with proper toast notifications
- Shows workflow metadata (steps count, trigger type)
- Includes workflow-specific icons

### 5. **Workflow Execution API** (`src/routes/api/workflows/execute/+server.ts`)
- Accepts workflow ID and service schema
- **FIXED**: Now properly handles workflow definitions passed from UI
- **NEW**: Creates workflow_executions table records
- Simulates workflow execution (ready for Temporal integration)
- Returns execution status

### 6. **Enhanced Initial Chat** (`src/routes/+page.svelte`)
- **NEW**: Conversational interface that asks clarifying questions
- Context-aware questions based on service type:
  - Restaurant systems: tables, reservation types, special requests, etc.
  - Inventory systems: item types, locations, reordering, expiration tracking
  - Generic: entities, users, workflows, integrations
- Builds comprehensive requirements through dialogue

### 7. **Workflow Status Component** (`src/lib/components/ui/workflow/WorkflowStatus.svelte`)
- **FIXED**: Now shows actual workflow count from service metadata
- **NEW**: Fetches real data via new metadata API endpoint
- Displays execution statistics (placeholder for Temporal data)

### 8. **Calendar View Component** (`src/lib/components/ui/calendar/CalendarView.svelte`)
- **NEW**: Full calendar UI component for scheduling/availability
- Month view with navigation
- Event indicators on dates
- Selected date details panel
- Supports reservations, bookings, and scheduling workflows

### 9. **Service Metadata API** (`src/routes/api/services/[schema]/metadata/+server.ts`)
- **NEW**: API endpoint to fetch service metadata
- Returns workflows, entities, and UI components
- Used by workflow components to get real data

### 10. **Workflow Executions Table**
- **NEW**: Database table to track workflow runs
- Stores workflow definition, status, input/output
- Includes proper indexes and RLS policies

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Service Creation**:
   - User describes their service need
   - **NEW**: AI asks clarifying questions to gather detailed requirements
   - OpenAI generates coherent schema + workflows + UI with extended context
   - System validates coherence
   - Service is created with all three legs intact

2. **Workflow Execution**:
   - UI displays available workflows from service metadata
   - User clicks "Run Now" button
   - API starts workflow execution (simulated for now)
   - Execution is tracked in database
   - Results update in real-time

## üöÄ Key Improvements Made

1. **Clarifying Questions**: The system now engages in a conversation to gather comprehensive requirements
2. **Real Workflow Counts**: Fixed the hardcoded "11 workflows" issue - now shows actual count
3. **Working Workflow Triggers**: Workflows can now be triggered from the UI
4. **Calendar Component**: Added for scheduling/availability visualization
5. **Extended AI Context**: Increased token limit for richer service generation
6. **Better UI Layout**: Maintained standard three-pane layout with proper styling

## üí° Key Innovation

The system is **completely dynamic** - no workflow is hard-coded. The AI generates the workflow definition based on conversational requirements gathering, and our generic worker can execute it. This means infinite flexibility while maintaining architectural coherence.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Alignment

This implementation perfectly aligns with OSP's core principles:
- **Three-Legged Stool**: Schema, Workflows, and UI are generated together
- **AI-Driven**: OpenAI creates the entire service definition with context
- **Dynamic**: No hard-coding, everything is data-driven
- **Coherent**: Built-in validation ensures all parts work together
- **User-Friendly**: Conversational interface for requirements gathering

## üìù Example Generated Workflow

```json
{
  "id": "phone_reservation",
  "name": "Phone Reservation Booking",
  "description": "Books a table reservation via phone",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "ui_action",
    "source": "reservation_form"
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "validate_availability",
      "name": "Check Table Availability",
      "type": "check_availability",
      "target_entity": "restaurant.table",
      "availability_filters": {
        "date": "input.date",
        "time_slot": "input.time"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "create_reservation",
      "name": "Create Reservation",
      "type": "create_entity",
      "target_entity": "restaurant.reservation",
      "uses_fields": ["customer_name", "phone", "date", "time", "party_size"],
      "updates_fields": ["status", "workflow_state"]
    }
  ]
}
```
